https://youtu.be/0uriX3-jSls <--As Explained in a more textual manner: 

The goal here is to have a simple text field in the general tab of Woo's single-product.php so that when the store owner is typing up their wonderful new product, they can customize text that appears on that particular product's page.
Nope. Don't care about archive pages.
Yep. I know there's other plugins that "claim" to do "parts" of this, but *this* is very specific.
Yes, I could do this all day with code snippets.

The plugin is for WooCommerce store owners who simply need to change the "Add To Cart" text, and to give them a simple & easy way to do that.
